Input Program was an assignment of mine during Intro
to Python. I selected this program in particular to 
post for this assignment because I was very proud of
how I utilized a dictionary for the gender input.

To use this program, a user inputs their name, gender,
date of birth, and where they live, and it will output
a statement with all said data.
